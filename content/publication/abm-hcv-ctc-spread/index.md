abstract: "Mechanisms that lead to viral chronicity are poorly understood, but cell-to-cell spread has been
implicated in the establishment of chronic infections. We previously developed two stochastic
mathematical models to explore the nature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell-to-cell spread in vitro
and quantified the effect of inhibiting individual host factors. However, the previous models were
not designed to differentiate focus expansion due to spread vs cell proliferation, focus shape,
cell size, or foci merging. Here we have developed an agent-based model (ABM) to more fully
describe this biological system. The ABM recapitulates the dynamic cell population in which
individual cells progress through different cell cycle and infection stages and proliferate resulting
in increasing cell number with concomitant decrease in size mimicking cells becoming tightly
packed in culture. The ABM recapitulates the observed irregular HCV foci shape suggesting that
this is a product of the stochastic nature of cell-to-cell spread. In silico alteration of cell
proliferation rates indicated that the cell division observed within the cultures exerts minimal
effect on measured cell-to-cell spread rates. The model fits the data well, confirms our previous
prediction that HCV spread is best described by a hybrid of two stochastic models and has the
potential to give more accurate predictions regarding HCV cell-to-cell spread."
